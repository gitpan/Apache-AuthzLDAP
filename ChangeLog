2001-05-27	Christian Gilmore <cgilmore@tivoli.com>

        o  Deprecated generic variable naming in favor of
           module specific to reduce potential conflict with
           other auth modules: 
	      GroupAttrType   -> AuthzGroupAttrType
	      GroupAttrValue  -> AuthzGroupAttrValue
	      LDAPServer      -> AuthzLDAPServer
	      LDAPPort        -> AuthzLDAPPort
	      MemberAttrType  -> AuthzMemberAttrType
	      MemberAttrValue -> AuthzMemberAttrValue
	      NestedGroups    -> AuthzNestedGroups
	      UidAttrType     -> AuthzUidAttrType
	   Original variable names are still accepted but will be removed
 	   on the next major release. This change allows for user
	   information to be hosted on one LDAP while group information is
	   hosted on another.
	o  Made release 0.60.
